# A0 status ledger

Updated 2026-09-29. Durable state for the next session: scope, evidence, blockers, next action.
Every claim below is either reproduced by a command in this repo or labelled as not run.

## Provenance

The starter archive `A0-Research-Starter.zip` was not present on the workstation, in
iCloud, or on GitHub (full-disk search, both GitHub accounts). This implementation was
rebuilt from `DESIGN.md` and the handoff spec (`HANDOFF.txt`). It follows the documented
package map and semantics but is not byte-identical to the original package; the
original report is kept as `results/verification-handoff-2026-09-29.json` and is *not*
reproduced evidence (different corpus generator, different case count). If the archive
turns up, reconcile against this tree rather than overwrite either.

## Design decisions recorded from the user (2026-09-29)

- Human readability is not a constraint. The representation is optimized for AI read/write
  cost and correctness; audit views may be derived, never the primary form.
- Any change must be rejected before commit if it fails parsing, typing, or revision
  matching; well-typed wrong behavior is caught by acceptance tests, not by syntax.
- Execution performance across targets is a goal with a ledger, not a claim; ties and
  losses stay visible.

## Implemented scope (v0.8.0)

- Types `u32`, `bool`; ops `mov add sub mul and or xor shl shr eq lt select` with exact
  wrapping/logical/unsigned semantics; positional params; one result; straight-line.
- **`call f a...`** (new): applies a function defined *earlier* in the program (acyclic,
  no recursion); typed against the callee; evaluated by interpreter and BigInt oracle;
  constant-folded and CSE'd; emitted as a call in JS/C/Java and as a module instance
  in SystemVerilog.
- **`fold f n s a...`** (new): bounded iteration `state = f(state, i, a...)` for `i` in
  `0..n-1`; u32 trip count guarantees termination. Interpreter, oracle, compile-time
  evaluation up to 4096 trips, zero-trip identity, counted loops in JS/C/Java (Java uses an
  unsigned bound), literal-count unrolling (≤256) in SystemVerilog with a precise
  diagnostic for variable counts.
- **`loop p f n s a...`** (new, Gate 1): `fold` with early exit; predicate `p` shares the
  body's parameters and returns bool; the u32 cap guarantees termination. Same coverage as
  fold (interpreter, oracle, compile-time evaluation, loops with `break` in JS/C/Java,
  literal-cap unrolling with a done-latch chain in SystemVerilog, generator coverage).
- **Arrays and records** (new, Gate 2): types `TxN` and `(T0,…,Tk)`, nestable; ops `arr rec
  get set at put`. Value semantics everywhere (no aliasing, copies on update); `get`/`set`
  reduce the index modulo N so they are total. Interpreter, oracle, optimizer (literal
  `get`/`at` of a built aggregate folds to the element), JS (copy-on-write + shape guards),
  C (structs by value, also C++), Java (arrays clone-on-write, records), SystemVerilog
  (packed vectors, part-selects, `always_comb` for updates). Public functions with
  aggregate signatures are emitted with the documented ABI but the differential drivers
  only call scalar-signature functions; aggregate functions are covered through `call`.
- **Effects** (new, Gate 3): type `io` is a linear capability token; `read t -> (u32,io)`,
  `write t v -> io`. Consumed at most once, one io parameter per function, no tokens in
  arrays or `select`; token dependencies define effect order, so no separate sequencing
  exists. Optimizer anchors effectful nodes (read/write/calls/iterations carrying tokens)
  and still drops pure extractions. Runtimes: JS stream object, C `a0_io` fixed-capacity
  struct (freestanding, also used in Wasm through linear memory at `__heap_base`), Java
  `A0Io`.
- **Sequential hardware** (new, Gate 4, `src/hw.ts`): functions that iterate with variable
  counts, perform io, or call such functions become clocked SystemVerilog modules
  (clk/rst/start/done, in/out word handshakes). Stages of a linear FSM in program order;
  stage results are registers; bodies instantiated once and stepped per clock; sequential
  callees via nested handshakes; loop predicates must be combinational (diagnosed).
  Pure functions stay combinational; literal-count folds in pure functions stay unrolled.
  Not implemented: general regions, pipelining/scheduling beyond one stage per clock,
  timing closure.
- **Application** (Gate 5): `examples/life.a0`, Conway's Life on a 32×32 torus written
  entirely in A0 (17 functions: arrays, folds over 1024 cells, calls, popcount, and an io
  session protocol: 32 rows + command + x + y in, 32 rows out, population as result).
  Acceptance: `bun run app` runs 134 cases (named patterns over 6 generations, toggles with
  wrapping coordinates, clears, 40 seeded random grids) whose expected values come from an
  independent TypeScript Life implementation, through interpreter, optimizer, JS, C (clang
  + UBSan), C++, Wasm, and JVM. Browser: `bun run site` builds `site/dist` (life.wasm, a
  DOM adapter `site/app.ts` that only draws and forwards clicks, index.html); verified in
  the in-app browser: a glider advances by (1,1) after four generations. Not deployed.
- **The page itself in A0** (`site/page.a0`, v0.8.0): the a0lang.com page is an A0 io
  program speaking a small UI protocol over the word stream (OPEN tag, TEXT bytes,
  CLOSE, ATTR, ONCLICK event, STATE word, COMPONENT id); every heading, paragraph,
  button label, click handler, and the counter's decimal rendering (div/rem) come from
  A0. The browser adapter (`site/app.ts`) only interprets the stream, builds DOM, feeds
  clicks back with the persisted state word, and mounts Life as component 1. Verified in
  the in-app browser: three clicks show "Clicked 3 times" with state 3 kept by the A0
  program; Life glider still correct. The remaining non-A0 parts are the adapter and
  the CSS shell (a runtime, like a browser), and the wasm loader.
- **Resource bounds** (user requirement 2026-09-29, compute-bomb protection): the reference
  interpreter takes a fuel budget (default 10^8 node evaluations, shared across nested
  calls) and aborts with a diagnostic; compile-time evaluation in the optimizer is
  fuel-bounded and gives up instead of stalling; the validator computes a static iteration
  bound per function (variable counts count as 2^32, reported in `staticIterations`) and
  rejects programs whose *literal* nested trip counts exceed 2^24; parser input, function
  and node counts, aggregate bit width, array length, edit sessions, emission cache, and
  toolchain process time (120 s) were already bounded; recursion is impossible by
  construction. A 3000-mutation fuzz test asserts every malformed input fails with a clean
  A0Error. Not done: a runtime fuel counter in compiled targets (costs speed; measure
  before adding), memory/time limits per compiled process, sandboxing of toolchains.
- **GPU** (Gate 8, `src/metal.ts`, `bun run gpu`): the io-free corpus mapped to Metal
  Shading Language through an explicit type layer over the C output, elementwise kernels
  per function, executed on the local GPU via a generated Swift host: 4995 oracle cases
  across 31 kernels pass on Apple M3. Exact semantics only; no GPU performance claim,
  no memory-space or scheduling model beyond elementwise dispatch.
- **.NET** (Gate 8, `src/dotnet.ts`, `bun run dotnet`): C# emission (native `uint`,
  clone-on-write arrays, `readonly record struct`s, `A0Io` stream runtime), built Release
  with warnings as errors on .NET SDK 10.0.401 (installed user-locally under ~/.dotnet
  from the official pkg; the Homebrew cask needs an interactive sudo), executed through
  the stdin driver: 5603 cases incl. io streams pass.
- **MLIR/LLVM decision** (Gate 8): not integrated. Evidence: every kernel of the execution
  ledger ties hand-written C and Rust at clang/rustc -O2 (both LLVM); the native path
  already reaches LLVM through C. Integration would add build complexity without a
  measured win; revisit when a workload needs vectorization or fusion the C path cannot
  express.
- **Strength reduction and io memory bound** (v0.8.5): `div`/`rem` by a literal power of
  two become `shr`/`and` in the optimizer (exact for unsigned); hardware synthesis of the
  corpus fell from 30 s to 23 s (remaining dividers have non-power-of-two literal or
  variable divisors). The reference evaluator caps io output at 2^20 words so a runaway
  writer cannot exhaust memory (test).
- **Persistent artifact cache** (v0.8.4, `src/cache.ts`): on-disk, content-addressed;
  per-function emission keyed by compiler version, target, optimization level, and
  semantic revision (own text + transitive callees); wasm artifacts keyed by toolchain
  identity, flags, and the exact module text. Used by `a0 emit` and `a0 wasm`
  (`A0_NO_CACHE=1` disables, `A0_CACHE_STATS=1` reports). Measured on Life (17 functions):
  cold C emission + wasm build 491 ms, fully cached 39 ms, after editing one leaf function
  161 ms with 6 functions re-emitted (the leaf and its transitive callers) and one native
  rebuild. Correctness: a callee edit invalidates callers (tested); cache-served output is
  byte-identical to uncached output (tested).
- **Model guide compacted** (v0.8.3): every rule retained, 1010 → 610 o200k tokens; the
  A0 experiment setup cost is now 627 (conventional) / 750 (structured) versus 48/127 for
  TypeScript and 63/142 for Rust. Whether the compact wording is as effective for models
  is exactly what Gate 6 measures; both wordings are in git history.
- **Program-level edits** (v0.8.2): a program handle (`g0`) views every function
  signature and accepts whole `fn … end` blocks (replace in place or append) and
  `-fn name` removals, validated as one program and committed atomically; stale after any
  other edit. The experiment gained a `create` task (add `cube` reusing `sq`) and the
  TypeScript/Rust line protocols gained insert (`+n`) and delete (`-n`) so all
  representations can create; 13 tasks, self-check passes.
- **Structured edits and scoped views** (v0.8.1): edit lines now insert (`id op …`, or
  `… @ other` to place after a node), delete (`-id`), and change the result (`ret x`),
  in patches and sessions alike, validated as one function and committed atomically;
  the `deps` view scope shows a function plus one signature line per direct callee, which
  is everything a type-correct edit can depend on. Measured on Life: editing `session`
  needs 239 tokens of view instead of 1746 for the whole program (o200k; 7.3× less to
  read), on top of the 877-token language guide paid once per session.
- **Text, division, streaming** (v0.8.0): `text "…"` desugars to `arr` of UTF-8 byte words
  with the source form retained (quote-aware comments in parser, patches, and sessions);
  `div`/`rem` are total unsigned (zero divisor → all ones / dividend, RISC-V convention;
  a 32-bit divider in hardware, synthesis time rose from 1.6 s to 30 s); `puts t a` emits
  the length word then the elements of a u32 array. Coverage: corpus 5946 cases (94 div,
  111 rem, 8 puts) on all 8 software paths, .NET, GPU (5418 io-free cases, 33 kernels),
  and clocked hardware (puts is a streaming stage). 19 tests.
- **JS emission, aliasing-safe in-place updates**: `set`/`put` mutate in place when the
  value is provably unshared (a fresh `arr`/`rec`/`set`/`put` result whose only other uses
  are earlier `get`/`at` reads and which is not returned), iteration bodies get an
  owned-state variant (`a0o_`) whose accumulator is copied once unless the initial value
  is already unshared, and scalar-element arrays are `Uint32Array`/`Uint8Array`.
  `get`/`at` results are never mutated because they alias their container. Verified by
  the 5603-case corpus (heavy aliasing) and Life. The array kernel loss dropped from
  2.6× to ≈1.3–1.6× (run-to-run noise on this machine is of the same order).
- **JS emission**: input guards now run only at the public boundary; internal calls,
  folds, and loops target unguarded `a0i_` functions (the 64-step loop went from 4× slower
  than hand-written to a tie).
- Edits: self-contained patch (`patch name sha256 … end`) and session handle edits
  (`e0` + replaced lines). Replace-existing-nodes only. Handles are one-use and
  revision-bound. No insertion/deletion, no multi-function transactions, no network service.
- Emission cache keyed on compiler version, target, opt level, and **semantic revision**
  (own content + transitive callees); editing a callee invalidates callers (tested).
- Backends: JS (ES module with public input guards), C (also valid C++), Java, SystemVerilog.
- Safety principle (user requirement 2026-09-29): every model-authored program or edit is
  parsed, type-checked, and revision-matched *before* commit; a malformed edit is
  rejected with a diagnostic and the program is untouched. This does not stop a model
  from writing a wrong-but-well-typed program; acceptance tests do that (Gate A harness).

## Reproduced checks (this machine: macOS 27.2 arm64, Node v24.14.0, Bun 1.3.4)

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Lint (Biome 2.2.4) | `bun run lint` | pass (previously blocked) |
| Typecheck (tsc 5.9.3, strict) | `bun run typecheck` | pass |
| Focused tests | `bun run test` | 24/24 pass (incl. fuel, static cap, 3000-mutation fuzz, page protocol, structured and program-level edits, persistent cache) |
| Life acceptance (134 cases, independent reference) | `bun run app` | pass on interpreter, optimizer, JS, C, C++, Wasm, JVM |
| Life in the browser (Wasm + DOM adapter) | `bun run site`, in-app browser | glider moves (1,1) in 4 steps, population 5 |
| GPU (Metal, Apple M3) | `bun run gpu` | 4995 io-free cases across 31 kernels pass |
| .NET (C#, SDK 10.0.401 Release) | `bun run dotnet` | 5603 cases incl. io streams pass |
| Interpreter vs oracle | `bun run verify` | 5603 cases pass |
| Optimizer vs oracle | `bun run verify` | 5603 pass |
| JS in Node | `bun run verify` | 5603 pass |
| C via Apple clang 21, UBSan | `bun run verify` | 5603 pass |
| C via GNU gcc-15, **no sanitizer** (macOS gcc has no libubsan) | `bun run verify` | 5603 pass |
| C-compatible source as C++17 via clang++, UBSan | `bun run verify` | 5603 pass |
| Java via Homebrew OpenJDK 27 | `bun run verify` | 5603 pass |
| WebAssembly (Homebrew clang 23 + wasm-ld, wasm32 freestanding) | `bun run verify` | 5603 pass, executed in Node's WebAssembly runtime; no browser/DOM test |
| SystemVerilog RTL simulation (Icarus 12, `-g2012`, clocked testbench) | `bun run hw` | 5603 cases pass on all 48 functions (11 clocked modules: every io function; literal-count iteration stays combinational); 0.8 s |
| SystemVerilog generic synthesis (Yosys 0.69 `synth -noabc` + `check -assert`) | `bun run hw` | pass in 1.6 s for all 48 modules incl. clocked ones; ABC optimization stalled >5 min on 32-bit multipliers, so it is off and cell counts are unoptimized |
| Not run for hardware | — | FPGA place-and-route, real cell library, timing, area, power, sequential logic |

Corpus: 48 seeded functions, seed 0xa0beef / input seed 0x12345678, 56 call, 28 fold, 19 loop, 79 arr, 69 rec, 59 get, 126 set, 24 read, 22 write sites; 11 io functions with 608 stream cases,
sha in `results/verification.json`. Deterministic generated inputs, not application evidence.

Bugs found and fixed by hardware simulation: (1) SV emitted `literal[4:0]` for shifts by a
constant (illegal); (2) the first clocked emitter initialized a stage's registers on the
same clock edge that latched the previous stage's result, so the first run of every module
used a stale register (only the first case of a function failed; later runs reused the
previous value); (3) handshakes asserted during a stage's entry cycle transferred every
word twice. Each was caught only by simulation against the oracle.

## Measurements (evidence level stated per row)

### Token probe (`bun run tokens`, js-tiktoken o200k_base / cl100k_base — OpenAI encodings, NOT Claude's tokenizer)

| Fixture | bytes | o200k tokens | Verdict vs baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| affine in A0 | 62 | 30 | **loss** vs hand-written C (29); win vs TS (35); ~tie vs Python (32) |
| A0 session edit | 14 | 9 | win vs TS line-replace session edit (20), TS search/replace (42), unified diff (79) |
| A0 self-contained patch | 93 | 48 | loss vs TS search/replace (42); win vs unified diff |
| MODEL_GUIDE.txt (setup A0 must pay) | — | ~489 | pure overhead; TS setup note ~48 |
| 48-fn corpus A0 vs emitted JS/C/Java | 42.7 kB | 23k vs 45–52k | not fair: baselines are machine-generated, not hand-written |

Level: local payload token counts. Not an AI-task experiment. The session-edit win is
largely a protocol effect; the 2×2 harness exists to separate it from the language effect.

### Execution ledger, Gate 7 (`bun run exec-bench`, clang -O2 no sanitizer; Node JIT warm; idle machine)

| Kernel | C emitted vs hand-written C | vs hand-written Rust (rustc 1.96 -O) | JS emitted vs hand-written |
|---|---|---|---|
| affine, rotl, clamp, mix (scalar) | tie | tie | tie |
| ident (tiny call) | tie (1.61 ns) | tie | tie/loss ≤11 % across runs (13.6 vs 12.4 ns): wrapper indirection, within noise |
| noop (add 0, mul 1, xor 0) | tie | tie | tie |
| chain3 (three nested tiny calls) | tie | tie | tie |
| branchy (select chains) | tie | tie | tie |
| arrfill (8 value-semantics `set`s) | tie | tie | **loss** ≈1.3–1.6× (156 vs 97 ns best run) after in-place updates and typed arrays; was 2.6× |
| loop64 (64 dependent body calls) | tie (80 vs 82 ns) | tie (80 ns) | tie (was 4× loss before boundary-only guards) |
| build time A0 source → native binary (clang) vs rustc -O | 52–67 ms vs 104–116 ms (rustc first run 4.3 s cold) | | |
| startup (spawn + one iteration) | 2.2–2.5 ms both sides | | |
| binary size | 33.6 kB both sides (runtime dominated) | | |

Rust ties on every kernel because A0's native path and rustc both end in LLVM; a CPU
runtime advantage over Rust for the same computation is not available to any language.
Where A0 differs measurably: build latency (~2× faster than rustc here), reach (the same
source runs on GPU, .NET, JVM, Wasm, and as clocked hardware), and, unmeasured until
Gate 6 runs, AI cost per accepted change (Rust is now a baseline representation there).

Verdict band: 8 % or observed sample spread, capped at 25 %. Level: micro-kernels; not
energy, memory at scale, or applications. The JS array loss is a real cost of value
semantics without escape analysis and stays on the ledger.

### Cost target stated by the user (2026-09-29): 200–400× cheaper and faster for AI

Measured baseline: whole-function payloads ≈1× hand-written C (30 vs 29 tokens), session
edits ≈2× smaller than the best conventional edit, A0 setup ≈877 tokens of overhead
(now 610 after compaction; Rust setup 63, TypeScript 48). Runtime vs Rust: tie on every kernel (see ledger).
Syntax cannot reach the target; the candidate mechanisms are structural and unmeasured:
(1) a library of verified named operations so a model writes one line instead of an
implementation, (2) dependency-scoped views so it reads only what an edit touches,
(3) delta-only edits, (4) validation that removes retries. Gate 6 measures whole-task
cost; the target is recorded as an ambition, not a result.

### Gate A / Gate 6: 2×2 AI-edit experiment (`bun run experiment`)

Harness implemented and self-checked (reference solutions pass, originals fail, in all
four cells: A0/TS × conventional/structured). Whole-task accounting: setup, view, output,
provider usage, calls, validation failures, repairs, wall time; reasoning tokens recorded
as null. **Status: unrun.** Requires `A0_ALLOW_PAID_MODEL_CALLS=1` plus Anthropic
credentials (none configured on this machine); default model `claude-opus-5-5`, 3 trials
per cell. Twelve held-out tasks (targeted, multi-node, multi-function, comprehension,
iteration, records) with independent acceptance tests across three representations
(A0, TypeScript, Rust; Rust acceptance compiles with rustc -O) and two protocols, six
cells; the self-check passes (references accepted, originals rejected in every cell).
Setup cost per cell (o200k): A0 conventional 627 / structured 750 after compacting the
guide, TypeScript 48/127, Rust 63/142; views 11–45 tokens. Measured setup cost per cell (o200k):
A0 conventional 877 tokens (MODEL_GUIDE.txt), TypeScript 48; view sizes 24–45.

## Reference

- Domain a0lang.com is registered on the user's Vercel account (2026-09-29) for the future
  landing/docs site; it is the Gate 5 application target.

## Repository

Private GitHub repo `Joe-Simo/a0` (verified `isPrivate: true`), branch `main`, project
at repo root, `bun.lock` committed, `dist/` and `node_modules/` ignored. Commits are
listed by `git log`; the push is verified against `origin/main` after each commit.

## Blockers / not done

- `A0-Research-Starter.zip` absent (see Provenance).
- Paid model runs not authorized; Gate A unrun.
- No Claude-tokenizer counts (needs `count_tokens` with credentials; free but blocked).
- Not implemented: loops/regions, memory/arrays, effects, .NET, GPU, mobile packaging,
  library import/FFI, persistent artifact cache, network edit service, fuzzing.

## Next concrete action

1. All eight gates have reproduced evidence except Gate 6's live model runs, which stay
   **unrun** until spend is explicitly authorized (harness, tasks, and self-check are
   complete); MLIR/LLVM is recorded as not justified by measurement. Next engineering
   targets, in order: (a) done: aliasing-safe in-place updates and typed arrays in JS
   (residual ≈1.3–1.6× on the array kernel is allocation of the initial array plus the
   body call; next step would be inlining owned bodies); (b) done: wrapper indirection is
   within noise; (c) run Gate 6 when authorized and add the whole-task numbers here;
   (d) done: text literals, div/rem, puts, and the UI protocol; the page is authored in
   A0. Next: deploy to a0lang.com only with explicit approval; richer UI protocol
   (inputs, lists) as the site needs them; Gate 6 live runs when authorized.
2. Gate 5 target decided: the a0lang.com site (domain owned by the user on Vercel) is the
   cross-target application, authored in A0 with a browser DOM adapter; no deployment
   without explicit approval in that session.
2. Expand the Gate A task set (≥10 held-out tasks incl. multi-function edits) and run it
   when authorized; report per-cell accepted-change cost with uncertainty.
